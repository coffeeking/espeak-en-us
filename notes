end of sentence stress, eg does espeak put primary stress on the first syllable of the last word? I've been assuming not, so have been changing stress accordingly.
 Eg embolism is pronounced, afaik, with stress on the first syllable. But if I review the word it sounds off. Thoughts?

speaking speeds: If I have espeak turned up to between 430 and 450 (if I go over that sonic kicks in and it sounds off), the "ar" "or" and "ire" seem to be cut short. I don't think the 
phonemes need adjusting, but maybe it's a question of speed? 
Words like tuner, zune, etc have a very pronounced y, 'tju:n3, 'zju:n, but words like tune, tuned, etc aren't affected. Any ideas? I'm stumped.


words like diet, bias, etc need a phoneme change, I think. The aI@ phoneme doesn't sound quite right. I'm not sure how to explain it, the i sounds way too drawn out. compare aI and aI@ and you 
can notice it.

should eprfect, read, etc have more accurate $past detection? Espeak sometimes fails to speak the past tense and instead reads teh present, eg have read, should have read. Then agein no synth 
can be perfect.
