I thought about requesting a rule for file extentions, eg .ogg, etc, but user feedback says otherwise and I kind of like the way espeak says them now, I can always fix the more badly mangled

notes on the aI@ phoneme, diet, bias, etc. I think it's spoken with a slight y at the end. It's hard to explain but it probably needs a phoneme change, so that that phonemes ends on a very 
slight y. kind of like aI;-@ but a little shorter.

 root word geo: Words like george, georgetown etc should probably not be covered by the change if there is one or it will mispronounce them.
$past detection. It's mostly accurate, but has content EG he has content on his mp3 player, is mispronounced. I'm not sure how to fix.
